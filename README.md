# Ensi

A programming game combining resource management (in the tradition of the
classic Hammurabi) with territorial conquest (inspired by generals.io).

## Concept

Players submit programs that compete against each other. Each program acts as
an **ensi** (Sumerian for "city governor"), managing resources and expanding
territory in an ancient Mesopotamian setting.

The core constraint: programs have a **limited number of instructions per
turn**. Victory goes to those who optimize their decision-making within these
computational bounds.
